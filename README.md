# ML Assignment 2 – Classification Models

This project compares six machine learning classification models:
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Metrics Used
Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, MCC

## Key Observations
- XGBoost achieved the highest MCC and AUC
- Random Forest showed high accuracy but poor recall due to class imbalance
- Logistic Regression provided balanced recall

Models were trained in Jupyter/Colab and deployed using Streamlit.
